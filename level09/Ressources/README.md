## Level 09

In this level, we have a program that takes an argument and increments by one all characters we write by incrementation.
It use the Rolling Cipher
For example: abc = ace

```bash
scp -P 4242 level09@192.168.56.101:~/token ~/Desktop
```

We make a script to apply this rule of incrementation

```bash
su flag09 -> f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
getflag
```
